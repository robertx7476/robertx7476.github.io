            <h1 class="margin text-center">Being Reincarnated CYOA</h1>
            <p>This is a CYOA project. CYOA stands for *choose your own adventure* so our project is interactable. And when I was choosing a topic, Ellen (my partner) also chose **Being reincarnated**. Before we started the project, we created a plan on what we should do and planned out the routes. We did all of our work on the IDE, so there was a lot of git adding, commiting, pushing, and pulling.</p>
            <p>Mr.Mueller(My teacher) assigned this project for many reasons. One was to continue making us practice using the IDE. By practicing we are getting better at using the IDE and memorizing the commands and solving conflicts. Another reason is to practice communicating with other people. Because we need to communicate to know when to pull others changes so you can push.</p>
            <p>There weren't any major challenges when we were working on this project. We just didn't time manage the work the best and the communcation between us was ok. We have multiple classes together so communicating to each other wasn't an issue. I also would have made the plan a little better because we did use most of the plan, but for two of our routes we just continued and went away from the plan.</p>

            <!--<p>Our group's goal was to make a halloween themed movie webpage using replit. My group included me, Melissa and Romeo. To make the webpage we used a lot of the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that we learned in class and applied it to our webpage.</p>
            <p>We all decided that the genres for our webpage will be action and horror. The title of our webpage was turn around and it was about Jaxson in hgihschool being ignored by his friends, so he make irrational decisions and wanted to murder all his friends. And we all worked well together and we helped each other with the code.</p>
            <p>Something we didn't do well during this prokect was the amount of communication happening in the beginning. We didn't communicate for the first few days outside of class but eventually I communicated and talked on slack so we had some cordination and so this process in making this webpage would've gone faster and we would've had time to make a sequel. But even with the lack of communcation, I am proud of our website on how it turned out with the colors and the gradient title. In class we were communicating a lot with each other by asking each other questions on the code and checking if the code is working properly. Overall doing this project taught me that I need to communicate better with others and work on my time management skills.</p>-->
